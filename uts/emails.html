       What about typography within emails? Unfortunately, due to the technical constraints of email systems, your options are limited.

      <p class="end2 next">
      Unlike a PDF, fonts don't get transmitted with an email. So even though you can compose an email in any font you like, recipients won't see that font unless they also happen to have it installed. Moreover, recipients get their email using a variety of hardware and software, which have inconsistent and unpredictable typographic capabilities.

      <p class="end2 next">
        The second meaning is the usual oneâ€”color as the opposite of black & white. This was once an irrelevant topic, as most of us had to be satisfied with monochrome laser printers. These days, color printers are ubiquitous and more writing is delivered on screen. So color has become a practical consideration.

      <p class="end2 next">
      On a page of text, nothing draws the eye more powerfully than a contrast between light and dark colors. This is why a bold font creates more emphasis than an italic font. (See also bold or italic.)

      <p class="end2 next">
      The perceived intensity of colored type depends not just on the color, but also the size and weight of the font. So a thin or small font can carry a more intense color than a heavy or large font.

      <p class="end2 next">
        I'm not saying it can never be done well, but when someone puts colored type on a colored background, I usually wish they hadn't.

        This leaves two plausible policies:

      <p class="end2 nextangka">
        If you must format your emails, stick with common system fonts, and make sure your messages don't rely on spacing tricks specific to the font. (Those of you who insist on aligning things with multiple word spaces were already warned.) Simpler is better.

      <p class="end2 nextangka">
        Or you can just treat email as a typography-free zone. This is my policy.

        BY THE WAY

        A lawyer I know appends a 200-kilobyte scan of his business card to every email. Nobody likes him. Use text, not an image, so your contact information can be copied and pasted easily.
