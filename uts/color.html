       In typography, color is a term with two meanings.

      <p class="end2 next">
        First, typographers will sometimes speak of a font as creating a certain color on the page-even when it’s black. Used this way, the word encapsulates a set of hard-to-quantify characteristics like darkness, contrast, rhythm, and texture.

      <p class="end2 next">
        The second meaning is the usual one—color as the opposite of black & white. This was once an irrelevant topic, as most of us had to be satisfied with monochrome laser printers. These days, color printers are ubiquitous and more writing is delivered on screen. So color has become a practical consideration.

      <p class="end2 nextangka">
      On a page of text, nothing draws the eye more powerfully than a contrast between light and dark colors. This is why a bold font creates more emphasis than an italic font. (See also BOLD or ITALIC.)

      <p class="end2 nextangka">
      The perceived intensity of colored type depends not just on the color, but also the size and weight of the font. So a thin or small font can carry a more intense color than a heavy or large font.

      <p class="end2 nextangka">
      I’m not saying it can never be done well, but when someone puts colored type on a colored background, I usually wish they hadn’t.

    <div class="container7">
      <p class="sub2"> IN PRINT</p>

      <p class="end2 next">
        body text in printed documents (e.g., résumés, research papers, letters) must always be set in black type. No exceptions.</p>

      <p class="end2 next">
        At a typical body-text point size, color isn’t effective as a form of emphasis. Small letterforms don’t cover much surface area on the page, so colored text isn’t noticed unless it’s loud.</p>

      <p class="end2 next">
        Professionally printed documents (e.g., letterhead, business cards) can include text set in color, but use it judiciously. Multiple shades of one color are usually better than multiple contrasting colors.</p>


      <p class="sub2"> ON WEBSITES</p>

      <p class="end2 next"> 
        Consider making your text dark gray rather than black. Unlike a piece of paper—which reflects ambient light—a computer screen projects its own light and tends to have more severe contrast. Therefore, on screen, dark-gray text can be more comfortable to read than black text. That’s why many digital-book readers let you reduce.

    <div class="container8">
      <p class="sub2"> IN PDFS</p>

      <p class="end2 next">
        PDFs are read on both screen and paper, so which set of rules you follow depends on how you expect the PDF to be used. If there’s a reasonable chance the PDF will be printed, don’t bother with dark-gray body text—it’ll look gritty and strange when printed.

    BY THE WAY

  <p class="endcenter2">
    I recommend color for bates numbering because it’s meant to stand out on the page.

  <p class="endcenter2">
    Color in presentations is covered in that section.
